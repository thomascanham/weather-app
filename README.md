## Challenge: Create a Weather Forecast App

*This has been generated by Chat GPT*

Your task is to create a weather forecast application that fetches weather data from an API and displays it on the screen. The application should allow users to search for a location and view the current weather conditions along with a 5-day forecast.

Requirements:

    1. The user should be able to enter a location in a search input field.
    2. On submitting the search form, the application should make an API request to fetch the weather data for the entered location.
    3. Display the current weather conditions for the location, including temperature, weather description, and any other relevant information.
    4. Display a 5-day forecast for the location, showing the date, weather icon, temperature range, and weather description for each day.
    5. Handle any error scenarios, such as invalid location or failed API requests, by displaying appropriate error messages to the user.
    6. Apply responsive design principles to ensure the application works well on different screen sizes.

Note: You can use any weather API of your choice to fetch the weather data. Some popular weather APIs include OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, and AccuWeather.

Feel free to use any additional libraries or frameworks (such as Axios for API requests or a UI component library like Material-UI) that you think would be helpful in completing the task.

Keep in mind that the above challenge is meant to assess your React.js skills, including component structure, state management, API integration, error handling, and responsive design. Focus on writing clean, maintainable code and organizing your components effectively.

Good luck with the coding challenge!
